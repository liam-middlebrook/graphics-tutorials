Description:
Contains code for generating a 3D Icosahedron, and then refining the edges down to create 
an Icosphere. This is a manner of generating a spherical-like object. By default, the number 
of revisions on the icosphere is 5, which can create a pretty mesmerizing effect (because I 
also have it randomizing the colors of each vertex and spinning around constantly). You can 
also choose to lower or increase the number of revisions.

WARNING: Performance will drop painfully once you reach the 7-9 revisions range. I haven't been 
able to push it past 9 revisions. Also note that this is incredibly inefficient in terms of the 
way it generates the points, so there may be a long startup time for a high number of revisions. 
Feel free to optimize it and send it back to me and I'll upload the better version!
